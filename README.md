## Instructions from Julian

Sure, you can get a sample (well, all) of the data here:
jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/links.html

> It would be good to start as follows:
>
> (1) Figure out how to read in the data and start playing with it. Start with the 5-core clothing dataset, or maybe even cut it down to a smaller subset.
>
> (2) Take a look at my lecture notes here:
> http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa15/cse255-a/
> In particular weeks 1 and 4 are relevant to what we're trying to do, beyond that we'll have to start looking at papers.
>
> (3) Some good initial papers to look at can be found at the end of the week 4 slides.
>
> (4) Set up a machine learning pipeline to evaluate and compare methods.
>
> (5) Once we reach that point (which I think is already non-trivial!) then we'll start thinking how we can extend the basic methods and implement more complicated techniques.
